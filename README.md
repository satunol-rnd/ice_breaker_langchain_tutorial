# About LangChain ü¶úÔ∏èüîó

## What Is LangChain ?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks and components. Hit the ground running using third-party integrations and Templates.
Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
Deployment: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe.
